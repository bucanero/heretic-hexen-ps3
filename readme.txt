Instalation
-----------

There are two ways for install

1) By PKG. On this occasion, copy the folder content "pkg" on the root큦 directory of the USB device and "Install Package Files" on the PS3

2) By SELF. On this occasion, copy "homebrew" on the root큦 directory of the USB device and load the aplications with the "Open Manager"
or another homebrew loader.

Heretic require the file HERETIC.WAD that can be copied where is EBOOT.BIN (/dev_hdd0/game/HERETIC01/USRDIR or
/dev_usb/homebrew/Heretic) or on the USB devide making the folder called "heretic" and copying HERETIC.WAD (/dev_usb/heretic/HERETIC.WAD)

The name MUST be on uppercase letters.

For short copying files, there is an utility starting the game: on the licence큦 screen you can press Circle button if you want to copy the content from dev_usb/heretic to the location of the game in the hard disk (/dev_hdd0/game/HERETIC01/USRDIR)

You can use a FTP program for copy HERETIC.WAD too.

For the files of HEXEN is something like the previous method, but in this occasion, is required HEXEN.WAD that must be copied to /dev_usb/hexen
(for all the instalations) or /dev_usb/homebrew/Hexen (Open Manager) or to /dev_hdd0/game/HEXEN0001/USRDIR (HDD).

And you can copy on the license큦 screen the content of /dev_usb/hexen a /dev_hdd0/game/HEXEN0001/USRDIR
pressing CIRCLE button
