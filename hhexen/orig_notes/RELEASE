Release notes for version 1.6.0 / 1.6.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bug Fixes:
 - Fixed a rare menu related crash.
 - Worked around audio corruption with the sdlmixer driver when SDL_mixer tried
   looping the background music.
 - Fixed interoperability of games saved on little and big endian machines.

New Features:
 - HHexen now uses a shared data path for its data files such as the wad files,
   external music files, etc.  The shared data path is decided in the following
   order:
   * -waddir <DIR>,  new command line option added in hhexen-1.6.0,
   * the HHEXEN_DATA environment variable,
   * --with-datapath=<DIR>, new configure (compile time) option added in 1.6.0,
   * the current working directory which has always been used as a last resort.
 - More configure options for more flexibility especially for packagers:
   * --enable-fullscreen: changes the game to run fullscreen by default.
   * --disable-userdirs : builds the engine without user directories support.

Notes:
 - The game save fix may break game files saved on big endian machines using
   hhexen-1.5.x.  The saves from little endian machines are fully compatible.

Release notes for version 1.5.3
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bug Fixes:
 - Fixed SDL and SDL_mixer audio drivers to honor the -nosound command
   line option.

New Features:
 - None.

Notes:
 - Added size sanity check for sfx lumps.
 - Ensured that the new gcc-4.4 series compilers are properly supported.
 - Renamed the "novideo" developer command line switch to "-novideo". Made
   the SVGALib driver to honor it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release notes for version 1.5.2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bug Fixes:
 - Fixed SDL_mixer freeze with zero music volume in some cases.

New Features:
 - Added support for external music files to the sdlmixer driver:
   External files with an .ogg, .mp3 or .mid extension are searched
   first (in that given order) before playing the lumps in the wad
   files.  The music files must be under the "music" subdirectory of
   the normal installation folder. If not found, the ~/.hhexen/music
   directory is searched.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release notes for version 1.5.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New Features:
 - Added SDL audio driver.
 - Added SDL_mixer audio driver with midi playback support.

Bug Fixes:
 - Fixed ARM support.
 - Fixed a few minor coding issues with big endian support.

Notes:
 - The configure script accepts a new --with-audio=<driver> option.  Valid
   values are oss, sdl, and sdlmixer.  sdl is the default option.  sdlmixer
   adds the ability of midi music playback.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release notes for version 1.5
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New Features:
 - Implemented intermission and finale screens for OpenGL.
 - Support for the Mac version of the demo hexen.wad file.
 - Support for big endian and 64 bit machines.

Bug Fixes:
 - Fixed a crash with binaries compiled by gcc-4.0.x series compilers.
 - Fixed a sound related crash on FreeBSD.

Notes:
 - Shareware wad files don't need a special configuration anymore.
 - HHexen now looks in the user directory for wad and lmp files, too.
 - The recorded demos are now written in the user directory.
 - All saved games from 32 bit, 64 bit, little endian and big endian machines
   are compatible with each other.
 - All of gcc-4.x series compilers are supported.
 - See ChangeLog for details.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release notes for version 1.4
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New Features:
 - Configs and savegames stored in users' home directories
 - SDL based software and GL targets

Bug Fixes:
 - Mouse skipping fixed once and for all

Notes:
 - Compiles with GCC 2.95 and newer versions.
 - See ChangeLog for details.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release notes for version 1.3
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New Features:
 - Autorun option
 - Variable screen resolutions for OpenGL versions
 - More graphics for assassin weapons

Bug Fixes:
 - Demos now sync correctly
 - Backstab now works better
 - Smoother mouse for X11 and OpenGL

Notes:
  To use any resolution for OpenGL, run HHexenGL with the switches "-width"
 and "-height".  Of course, you must specify the width and height you want
 after the appropriate switch. Sorry, but for now the X11 version is 
 staying with the double-size pixels.
  Using the autorun feature is straightforward.  It can be turned on or off
 from the "Options" menu.  Note that this is a "proper" autorun, meaning that
 if you press the "Speed" key while autorun is enabled it will cause you to
 walk.  Also note that autorun will not be enabled if you are recording a demo.
  Demos now sync properly!  Much thanks to Krzysztof Nikiel for fixing this.
  I know that the graphics for the crossbow look terrible.  I plan on doing
 them over sometime.  If you have artistic talent and would like to draw some
 graphics or fix up some of the existing ones, I will gratefully accept your
 submission.
  One last thing: HHexen now uses the file hhexen.cfg to store its settings.
 The simplest way to preserve your settings is to rename your hexen.cfg file.
 If you don't, a new file will be created using HHexen's default settings. 
 This may not be ideal, since there is currently no way to change mouse buttons
 from within the game.
