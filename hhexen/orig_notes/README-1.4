				     About

This is a new release of Dan's excellent Hacked Hexen, by the authors of
Hammer of Thyrion (HexenII). We're just applying fixes we have, and putting
this game back in the wild so people can contribute to it again.

Major changes with this release are:

  * OpenGL screenshots (now bound to F12 and enabled by default)
  * Game saves/loads work fine (CVS was broken for a while)
  * Transparent map feature (TAB key)
  * Many excellent GCC/C/portability bugfixes from Oz
  * Removal of incomplete assassin class now possible (with configure --disable-assassin)
  * More complete support for punctuation keys in the control-setup menu.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

				    Prereqs

There exist several versions of the hexen.wad file:

1.0 wads:
  b2543a03521365261d0a0f74d5dd90f0  hexen.wad (20,128,392 bytes)
  1077432e2690d390c256ac908b5f4efa  hexdd.wad (4,429,700 bytes)

1.1 wads:
  abb033caf81e26f12a2103e1fa25453f  hexen.wad (20,083,672 bytes)
  78d5898e99e220e4de64edaa0e479593  hexdd.wad (4,440,584 bytes)

Demo version:
  876a5a44c7b68f04b3bb9bc7a5bd69d6  hexen.wad (10,644,136 bytes)

The 1.0 wads may not be properly supported, and if you're having problems try
recompiling with the "991_possible_bug_fix" patch.

To run the demo, configure with:
  "./configure --enable-demowad"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

				   Compiling

Of course you'll need SDL and SDL-devel packages installed.
To compile the OpenGL version, type
	./autogen.sh
	./configure --enable-gl --disable-assassin
	make
This will hopefully give you a working binary, "hhexen-gl"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

				     Hints

Fullscreen is enabled by the ALT-Tab key combination.

Dan's fourth class, the Assassin, is not quite finished yet, and can be
disabled with "configure --disable-assassin". The precompiled binaries with
HHexen-1.4 do not have the assassin enabled. 
(*Warning*: There may be issues with game saves made from assassin enabled
binaries and from those without.  Enemies have been noticed to disappear!)

There is still no way to assign mouse buttons to actions in the
control-setup menu; it still needs some work. Currently mouse buttons can
still only be assigned to a few actions:

  mouseb_fire    (fire)
  mouseb_strafe  (strafe)
  mouseb_forward (move forward)
  mouseb_jump    (jump)

Which is done by editing $HOME/.hhexen/hhexen.cfg and changing these values.
Button values are:

  left   mouse button = 0
  middle mouse button = 1
  right  mouse button = 2
  unused              =-1

So, to make the right button jump, change the mouseb_jump line (in
.hhexen/hhexen.cfg) thus:

  mouseb_jump 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

				      Todo

* Do a full game run-through.
* Make a "Fullscreen" menu item
* Complete the list of options given by "--help"
* Make a menu item for mouse buttons... There is quite a lot of changes that
  need to be done to allow for the mouse buttons to be very configurable
* 64 bit compatibility (broken at present).
* Make sure big endian and non-intel compilations work.
