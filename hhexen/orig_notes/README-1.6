				 HHexen 1.6.1

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

				     About

This is a new release of Dan Olson's excellent Hacked Hexen by the authors
of Hammer of Thyrion (Hexen II).  We're applying fixes, adding a few features,
and ensuring it runs on most *nix operating systems.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

				    Prereqs

There exist several versions of the hexen.wad file:

1.0 wads:
  b2543a03521365261d0a0f74d5dd90f0  hexen.wad (20,128,392 bytes)
  1077432e2690d390c256ac908b5f4efa  hexdd.wad ( 4,429,700 bytes)

1.1 wads:
  abb033caf81e26f12a2103e1fa25453f  hexen.wad (20,083,672 bytes)
  78d5898e99e220e4de64edaa0e479593  hexdd.wad ( 4,440,584 bytes)

Demo wad 1.0 (from PC shareware hexndemo.zip):
  876a5a44c7b68f04b3bb9bc7a5bd69d6  hexen.wad (10,644,136 bytes)

Demo wad 1.1 (from Macintosh shareware MacHexenDemo.hqx):
  925f9f5000e17dc84b0a6a3bed3a6f31  hexen.wad (13,596,228 bytes)

We've done our best to support the old 1.0 wad files, but strongly
suggest that you patch your wads to version 1.1 to avoid possible issues.
If for some reason patching is not an option and you run into problems,
compile hhexen to specifically use version 1.0 hexen.wad:
  ./configure --enable-oldwad

Saved games and recorded demos from different wad versions are not
compatible.

Those without the full retail version of Hexen can still play the demo.
The newest demo wad (a 4 level version from the MacHexen shareware) can be
downloaded from http://hhexen.sourceforgef.net.  The PC shareware demo is
older, and not recommended: if you specifically want to use it, we suggest
recompiling hhexen with the --enable-oldwad option.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

				   Compiling

You'll need SDL and SDL-devel packages installed.

To compile the OpenGL version (hhexen-gl):
	./configure
	make

To compile the software version (hhexen-sdl):
	./configure --disable-gl
	make

The configure script accepts a new --with-audio=<driver> option.  Valid
values are oss, sdl, and sdlmixer.  sdl is the default option.  sdlmixer
adds the ability of midi music playback, therefore, to compile with midi
playback:

	./configure --with-audio=sdlmixer
	make

To compile the software version (hhexen-svga, for the old-fashioned :))
	./configure --enable-svga
	make

It's essential that you run make clean between different types of builds
or different types of targets.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

				Playing the Game

Put the file hexen.wad in the same directory where the hhexen binary is and
simply run the binary, for example:

	./hhexen-gl

With the -h or --help option, you can see the basic command line switches.

To play the Deathkings of the Dark Citadel expansion pack, put hexdd.wad in
the same directory and run:

	./hhexen-gl -file hexdd.wad

The -file option can also be used to play any extra hexen wads that you may
have. The option takes as many wad filename arguments as you give to it, at
least one name, of course. Remember, though, that the -file option makes the
engine to load extra wads: you always need hexen.wad as the base wad.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

			     Custom Music playback

Playback of external ogg, mp3 and midi files is available when hhexen is
configured with the "--with-audio=sdlmixer" option. This is done by placing
custom music files in $HOME/.hhexen/music .

A high quality OGG version of the original Hexen soundtrack is available for
download from Sycraft.org :  http://sycraft.org/content/audio/hexen.shtml
To install, download the normal or high quality archive and unzip it.  Create
the music directory:
	mkdir -p $HOME/.hhexen/music		(for most end users)
 or:
	mkdir -p <install_dir>/music		(if you prefer that way..)
 or:
	mkdir -p <shared_datapath>/music	(mostly for packagers)

Place the ogg files in that new "music" directory you just created. Now, when
the game is run, the new sound files should automatically be used.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

				     Hints

You can switch between windowed and fullscreen modes by the ALT-Enter key
combination.

Double-clicking with Mouse2 or Mouse3 acts as the 'activate' (or 'use') key.

There is still no way to assign mouse buttons to actions in the control-setup
menu; it needs some work.  Currently, the mouse buttons can only be
assigned to a few actions:

  mouseb_fire    (fire)
  mouseb_strafe  (strafe)
  mouseb_forward (move forward)
  mouseb_jump    (jump)

which is done by editing $HOME/.hhexen/hhexen.cfg and changing these values.
Button values are:

  left   mouse button = 0
  middle mouse button = 1
  right  mouse button = 2
  unused              =-1

So, to make the right button jump, change the mouseb_jump line in hhexen.cfg,
like so:

  mouseb_jump 2

The user created 4th class, Assassin, is not quite finished yet, and disabled by
default.  It can be enabled with "configure --enable-assassin".  The precompiled
binaries of HHexen do not have the assassin enabled.
Warning:  There *will* be issues with the game saves made from assassin-enabled
binaries and from those without, they are not compatible.
