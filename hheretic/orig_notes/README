				HHeretic v0.2.1

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

				    About

This is a new release of Dan Olson's excellent Hacked Heretic by the authors
of Hammer of Thyrion (Hexen II).  We're applying fixes, adding a few features,
and ensuring it runs on most *nix operating systems.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

				   Prereqs

You need a Heretic wad file. Both the retail and the shareware version work
just fine.  It is recommended, but not required, that you patch your wad file
to the latest version, 1.2 for the shareware, 1.2 or 1.3 for the retail.  See,
at the end, for the md5sums and file sizes of different heretic wad files.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

				  Compiling

You'll need SDL and SDL-devel packages installed.

To compile the OpenGL version (hheretic-gl):
	./configure
	make

To compile the software version (hheretic-sdl):
	./configure --disable-gl
	make

The configure script accepts a new --with-audio=<driver> option.  Valid
values are oss, sdl, and sdlmixer.  sdl is the default option.  sdlmixer
adds the ability of midi music playback, therefore, to compile with midi
playback:

	./configure --with-audio=sdlmixer
	make

To compile the software version (hheretic-svga, for the old-fashioned :))
	./configure --enable-svga
	make

It's essential that you run make clean between different types of builds
or different types of targets.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

				Playing the Game

Put the file heretic.wad (registered) or heretic1.wad (shareware) in the same
directory where the hheretic binary is and simply run the binary, for example:

	./hheretic-gl

With the -h or --help option, you can see the basic command line switches.

The -file option can also be used to play any extra heretic wads that you may
have. The option takes as many wad filename arguments as you give to it, at
least one name, of course. Remember, though, that the -file option makes the
engine to load extra wads: you always need heretic.wad as the base wad.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

			     Custom Music playback

Playback of external ogg, mp3 and midi files is available when hheretic is
configured with the "--with-audio=sdlmixer" option. This is done by placing
custom music files in $HOME/.hheretic/music .

A high quality OGG version of the original Heretic soundtrack is available for
download from Sycraft.org :  http://sycraft.org/content/audio/heretic.shtml
To install, download the normal or high quality archive and unzip it.  Create
the music directory:
	mkdir -p $HOME/.hheretic/music		(for most end users)
 or:
	mkdir -p <install_dir>/music		(if you prefer that way..)
 or:
	mkdir -p <shared_datapath>/music	(mostly for packagers)

Place the ogg files in that new "music" directory you just created. Now, when
the game is run, the new sound files should automatically be used.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

				     Hints

You can switch between windowed and fullscreen modes by the ALT-Enter key
combination.

Double-clicking with Mouse2 or Mouse3 acts as the 'activate' (or 'use') key.

There is still no way to assign mouse buttons to actions in the control-setup
menu; it needs some work.  Currently, the mouse buttons can only be
assigned to a few actions:

  mouseb_fire    (fire)
  mouseb_strafe  (strafe)
  mouseb_forward (move forward)

which is done by editing $HOME/.hheretic/heretic.cfg and changing these values.
Button values are:

  left   mouse button = 0
  middle mouse button = 1
  right  mouse button = 2
  unused              =-1

So, to make the right button fire, change the mouseb_fire line in heretic.cfg,
like so:

  mouseb_fire 2

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

				  Known Bugs:

- Clipping issues on some maps with OpenGL. Some tall rooms can be seen through
  skies, ie. skies not clipped properly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

				Notes / Issues:

- Saved game files are not interoperable between 32 and 64 bit and/or big endian
  and little endian machines: saves are byte order and word size dependant.
